                        <li>A Facebook tab application for Norton's Stuff campaign.
At the specified time, this application will stream (through uStream or other site) a 24 hour
continuous dramatic performance based around the profile information of the participants.
An accompanying administrative backend will allow campaign managers to moderate the registrants
before the event begins. This admin panel will also be used during the live event to queue up
upcoming profiles on the spot, allowing for a 24 hour long, completely unscripted, improv
performance. When an applicant has been selected as an upcoming performance, this panel willalso
post to the participant's wall.
Once the day-long theatre is concluded, the moderators will be able to get a list of the names
and times for each of the live performances to assist them in manually splicing the 24hr recording. They will then manually
post and tag each of these final clips on each participant's wall.</li>

                        <li>Summary: With agency partner Leo Burnett, The Nerdery developed a Facebook application for Norton Antivirus’ Stuff Theater campaign. To facilitate their 24-hour live improv event, we used Zend to create a Facebook integrated administrative system for event organizers and performers.</li>
                        <li>Background: To promote their computer protection software, Norton Antivirus and agency partner Leo Burnett teamed together to put on a live-streaming improv show featuring comedic reenactments of Facebook user statuses. Leo Burnett was handling the coordination of vendors, the venue and performers, and asked The Nerdery to build the corresponding Facebook application. The Chicago event was scheduled just 60 days from our project-kickoff date.</li>
                        <li>Method: While the Facebook streaming app was the most forward-facing part of the project, we also had to develop an intuitively usable administrative system for event organization – and integrate it with Facebook data that users allowed us to access for the performance. It was critical to have a content management process that was both intuitive and functional for the writers, producers, directors and performers.</li>
                        <li>UX: Our UX team laid out wireframes designed to keep the back-end as straightforward as possible. We developed a multi-tab system, with each tab focused on providing information to a particular role of the production team. The tabs were designed to manage content collected from profile info of consenting Facebook users, including name, location, relationship status, recent photos and status updates. Available material was presented for the writers to pull out what they liked, write their performance notes and then send over to the content editors, whose tab allowed them to sort through writers’ suggestions and either select them for the on-stage queue or discard the idea. The director’s tab displayed the stage queue, the viewer chat feed, and what was currently on performing.</li>
                        <li>Result: The event turned out to be a smashing success of improv troupes, jugglers, a chainsaw wood carver, a gospel choir and more – Norton’s team was thrilled with the results. We were grateful for Leo Burnett’s leadership and coordination in making the event go as seamlessly as it did and look forward to partnering in the future.</li>
